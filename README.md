# Benchmark: Python Julia C

This repo compares Python, Julia and C to compare their speed in matrix multiplication. Run `make dependencies` to install the dependencies.
Then run `make` to check the speed of each language from a matrix of size 10000 to 20000. After the program has finished, the text file 
`time taken.txt` also contains the average speed of the language for matrix of size 1000. Run `make clean` to delete the files created 
during the make process.
